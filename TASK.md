## Important Instructions For The Next AI Agent

1. Read this file completely.
2. Read Tree.md.
3. Read README.md.
4. Inspect the actual repository before changing anything.
5. Do not assume a task is incomplete simply because you have not seen it.
6. Verify the current code.
7. Continue from the first incomplete task unless there is a technical reason to change the order.
8. Update TASK.md after completing work.
9. Note: `apps/web` is Next.js 16 — its `AGENTS.md` warns that conventions may differ
   from older knowledge. Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing Next code.
   Key facts already verified: `params` is a `Promise` (await it), route groups work
   normally, `LayoutProps`/`PageProps` globals only exist after a build — this project
   uses explicit prop typing so `tsc --noEmit` works on a clean clone.

Note on 004–010: Task 002 delivered working placeholder versions of every route
(designed, data-driven, not empty). Tasks 004–010 should treat their pages as
"real but first-pass" — refine depth (filters, empty states, edit flows) rather
than rebuilding from scratch.

# Current Task

## Task 003 - Design System

Status: NOT STARTED

### Objective

Formalize SMMOMO's visual foundation so later feature work builds on tokens,
not ad-hoc Tailwind values.

### Requirements

- Design tokens in `globals.css` (`@theme`): color scale, spacing, radii, shadows
- Consolidate current zinc/indigo one-offs where repetition exists
- Typography scale (headings/body) consistent across pages
- Dark-mode decision: either implement properly with tokens or explicitly defer
- Document token usage in README or docs
- Do not restyle for its own sake — preserve the current clean SaaS feel

### Notes

- Current palette: zinc neutrals + indigo-600 accent + status colors (emerald/amber/red)
  via `components/ui/badge.tsx`.
- Buttons/inputs/cards already centralized in `components/ui/`.

# Completed Tasks

## Task 002 - Frontend Application Shell

Status: COMPLETE

Completed:

- Route groups: `(auth)` and `(dashboard)` with their own layouts.
- All V1 frontend routes created and rendering:
  `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`, `/automations`, `/automations/new`,
  `/automations/[id]`, `/posts`, `/inbox`, `/analytics`, `/settings`,
  `/settings/account`, `/settings/social-accounts`, `/settings/usage`.
- Responsive dashboard shell: fixed sidebar (drawer on mobile), sticky topbar,
  active-nav highlighting via `usePathname`, auto-close drawer on navigation.
- Landing page rewritten (hero, 3-step flow, features, CTA) — template page removed.
- API abstraction per master prompt §19: `lib/api/client.ts` + 6 feature modules.
  All UI data flows through `request()`; no fetch in components.
- Centralized mock data per §20: `lib/mock/` (accounts, posts, automations,
  comments, deliveries, analytics+usage) shaped like future API responses.
- Shared domain types in `types/index.ts`.
- UI primitives in `components/ui/` (Button, Card, Badge, Input/Label/Textarea)
  and layout components in `components/layout/` (shell, sidebar, topbar,
  page-header, inline SVG icons — no icon dependency added).
- Auth pages are functional UI with mock submit → `/dashboard` (real auth = Task 013).
- Social accounts page: Connect button intentionally disabled — no fake Meta flow.

What it does:

Provides the complete navigable frontend workspace with realistic mock-driven
content. Every route the master prompt §21 requires now exists, navigation works,
and the data seam for the future Fastify API is in place.

Files (key):

- apps/web/app/page.tsx (landing)
- apps/web/app/(auth)/{layout,login/page,register/page}.tsx
- apps/web/app/(dashboard)/{layout.tsx + dashboard, automations/*, posts, inbox,
  analytics, settings/*}
- apps/web/components/ui/{button,card,badge,input}.tsx
- apps/web/components/layout/{dashboard-shell,sidebar,topbar,page-header,icons}.tsx
- apps/web/lib/api/{client,automations,posts,social-accounts,analytics,usage,inbox}.ts
- apps/web/lib/mock/{accounts,posts,automations,comments,deliveries,analytics}.ts
- apps/web/types/index.ts
- apps/web/app/globals.css (forced single theme; auto-dark removed until tokens exist)

Technical decisions:

- `USE_MOCK` boolean in `lib/api/client.ts` is the single switch to real API;
  modules pass a mock resolver as fallback — flipping later touches one file.
- Explicit `{ children: ReactNode }` / `params: Promise<{id}>` prop typing instead
  of generated `LayoutProps`/`PageProps` globals (clean-clone typecheck safety).
- No icon/chart/image libraries: inline SVGs + CSS bars + gradient placeholders
  (offline-friendly, zero deps). Add libraries only when these fall short.
- Disabled-but-visible controls (Save, Connect, Edit, Pause) instead of hiding
  them — shows product shape without faking backend behavior.

Validation:

- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm run lint` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed (15 routes; `/automations/[id]` dynamic).
- Dev-server smoke test: all 14 concrete routes → HTTP 200;
  `/automations/missing` → 404 (correct `notFound()` behavior).

Known limitations:

- All data is mock; login/register submit only navigates (Tasks 013/014).
- Automation create/edit/activate are previews (Task 006).
- Design is coherent but not yet tokenized (Task 003).
- No `hooks/`, `stores/` — none needed yet.

Next:

Task 003 - Design System

## Task 001 - Project Initialization

Status: COMPLETE

Completed:

- Initialized git repository (no commits made yet — owner controls commit policy).
- Created npm workspaces monorepo root (`package.json`) with dev/build/lint/typecheck scripts.
- Created reserved folders: `docs/`, `tests/`, `docker/`, `packages/`.
- Scaffolded Next.js 16 frontend in `apps/web` (TypeScript, Tailwind v4, ESLint, App Router).
- Added root `.gitignore` and `.env.example` (secrets reserved/commented — no fake Meta credentials).
- Wrote `README.md`, `Tree.md`, and this `TASK.md`.
- Added `typecheck` script to `apps/web`.
- Updated page metadata to "SMMOMO".
- Replaced template `apps/web/README.md` with a pointer to root README.

What it does:

This establishes the initial SMMOMO repository structure and the documentation/handoff
system required for AI-assisted development. The frontend workspace compiles, lints,
builds, and serves.

Files:

- package.json
- .gitignore
- .env.example
- README.md
- Tree.md
- TASK.md
- apps/web/ (full Next.js scaffold)

Technical decisions:

- npm workspaces (no extra monorepo tooling — not needed yet).
- Next.js 16 with App Router; `LayoutProps<"/">` global replaced with explicit
  `{ children: ReactNode }` so `tsc --noEmit` passes on a clean clone.
- `docker-compose.yml`, `packages/shared`, `packages/config`, `apps/api`, `prisma/`
  intentionally NOT created yet — folders appear when they become necessary.
- Git initialized but uncommitted: no commits unless owner requests.

Validation:

- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm run lint` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed.
- `npm run dev` — HTTP 200 on `/`.

Task 002 - Frontend Application Shell

---

# Blocked Tasks

None.

---

# Deferred Tasks

- Payments/billing — V1 free during testing; usage tracking only (master prompt §34).
  Will surface as part of Task 019 unless the owner requests otherwise.
- Dark mode — deferred inside Task 003 until proper tokens exist (globals.css currently
  forces light theme so UI never lands half-styled).

---

# Important Technical Decisions

- **2026-09-23** — npm workspaces monorepo; frontend-first; mock API layer before real
  backend; Next.js 16 (verify docs before coding — breaking changes vs older Next).
- **2026-09-23** — `lib/api/client.ts` `USE_MOCK` flag is the single mock→real switch;
  feature modules pass mock resolvers as fallbacks.
- **2026-09-23** — explicit prop typing (not generated `LayoutProps`/`PageProps`) so
  typecheck works without a prior build.
- **2026-09-23** — no icon/chart/image dependencies yet; inline SVG + CSS only.

# Known Issues

- None currently failing. See Deferred for intentional gaps.
